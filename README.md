# Lab 8 - Starter

Written by: Me and myself.

Check my understanding:

1. I would fit my automated tests of my Recipe project development pipline by manually running them locally before pushing code because this is a relatively small project without the need of branch splitting, and the only way to ensure the main branch is correct is by verifying code before they are pushed.
2. No.
3. No, because "message" feature requires multiple different moving parts and unit test is only designed to test individual parts.
4. Yes, because "max message length" feature is an individual part, which unit test is designed for.
